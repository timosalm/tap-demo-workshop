Tanzu Application Platform makes it easy to discover, curate, consume, and manage backing services, such as databases, queues, and caches, across single or multi-cluster environments. 

This experience is made possible in Tanzu Application Platform by using the **Services Toolkit** component. 

Within the context of Tanzu Application Platform, one of the most important use cases is binding an application workload to a backing service such as a PostgreSQL database or a RabbitMQ queue. 
This use case is made possible by the [Service Binding Specification](https://github.com/k8s-service-bindings/spec) for Kubernetes. 

In our case we have a RabbitMQ cluster provided by the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator for Kubernetes running in the workshop namespace, which is used for asynchronous communication between our application and a ```sensors-publisher``` application that is also deployed in the workshop namespace.
```execute
kubectl get RabbitmqCluster
```
```execute
kubectl get deployments sensors-publisher
```
For both, the credentials that are required for the connection to the RabbitMQ cluster are injected as environment variables into the containers via a service binding.
```execute
kubectl get ServiceBinding
```
If we have a closer look at one of the ServiceBinding objects, we can see references to a ResourceClaim for the RabbitMQ Cluster and the Knative Serving Service of our application.
```execute
kubectl get ServiceBinding spring-sensors-rmq -o yaml | yq e '.spec' -
```
Additionally, the name of the Kubernetes Secret that includes the credentials for the RabbitMQ cluster is available in the `status.binding` field.
```execute
kubectl get ServiceBinding spring-sensors-rmq -o yaml | yq e '.status.binding' -
```
Behind the scenes, based on those Custom Resource Definitions objects, the Kubernetes Secret that includes the credentials will be mounted to the application containers as a volume.
